Although you can see real reviews from other Wanelo users, it's hard to find a reliable store and items.\nLike eBay, people may post false pictures of products to try to scam you, which is why I think Wanelo should also add the ratings of sellers and their reliability.

Security: wanelo is very safe as i've bought some things off the app and they all looked like picture came in a decent timeframe, and worked correctly, however, there have been some reviews of low profile shops posting fake photos of their \"products\" and scamming the people for their money. if wanelo went through all the shops they allow and verify the ones that are reliable and delete the ones who scam and show a verification tick on their profile somehow, it'd be ace.\n\n2. i purchased a set of makeup brushes from amazon a while ago and i figured i would put the review on amazon and wanelo for those people searching for makeup brushes on the app. i found the exact set, opened the review window, wrote my review AND added pictures, and it said that i couldn't review without proof i purchased it off the app, even though the link \u0026 picture was from amazon. please fix this ):\n\nother than these, it's an amazing app that i spend hours on daily.","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"5.8","id":"1331604063"},{"rating":"4","title":"Best Way To Window Shop","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"I'm obsessed with this app. You'll find so many unique products you would otherwise never come across in a mall. Of course shopping online always involves risk, some \"stores\" make clothing from cheap fabric, resell half empty/used bottles of nail polish, etc but ignore anyone who wrote a review blaming the creators of the app for this problem. Most likely those people are the ones who didn't do their research on the shop, read other user reviews or they're just unintelligent because you can almost always tell which shops are bootleg and if you can't right away a simple google search will do the trick. My one and only problem with this app is the trending page. The products are always the same and it never updates. It took sending 3 emails to 2 different addresses before I finally heard back from customer service, who told me the amount of traffic on the app causes the problem and that they're working on it. It's been months and the problem has not been fixed and it's extremely annoying. I see the same shirts, jewelry and other items every single time I open the app. I'm left using only the magic page or shopping by stores I follow, which is still fun, but the trending page is my favorite way to find new items and it doesn't work correctly.

It's a great way to find new products and stores. But it has a major downside. A LOT of the stores are stores in China making rip offs of originals. And terrible ones too. And those shops have the nerve to say they can custom make a prom dress (that they stole the photo from) for only $30. Now, it's obvious that you get what you pay for. If you see a beautiful prom dress, or any dress, and it's cheap and comes from China, don't take the risk. Not only that, Wanelo \"approves\" these types of stores, so you can't even trust Wanelo. When I do see something on Wanelo I want to buy, I go directly to the store online and buy it from there, not via Wanelo. That way I can check the site to make sure it's legit, because Wanelo can be deceitful. Another annoying thing is some Chinese stores will originally sell something for $30. They bump up the price to $70, then back to $30, so the sale alert shows up in my feed. It's very annoying when there's 7 or 8 notifications for something that basically didn't change price at all. Also, they used to have a really great feature where you could sort products based on price and store. It was SUPER helpful when like say I'm doing shopping on Amazon, I can look at all the products from Amazon I saved and then search for it. Wanelo, you need to take a Moral Decisions class.

The idea of Wanelo is brilliant. The old Wanelo used to show trending items and then give u a link to a website where u can buy them. These websites were all well known and reliable. However now, they don't have links to websites and instead you buy your things on Wanelo. However these companies are  all from china so a) it takes forever to come in b) the items/ clothes look nothing like the picture and c) the materials are very cheap looking. These \"companies\" that the items and clothes are from don't even have their own website which makes it very sketchy.  Also, since the only way you can buy it is on Wanelo, they make u pay an additional charge of their own \"Wanelo cost\"  separate from shipping.

I would also like to see reviews on the sellers, much like Amazon does.

Definitely happy that they finally added Apple Pay and PayPal as payment options, not sure if you can use PayPal to receive funds though. (That would be nice since direct deposit can take some time) my only complaint is the fee charged for listing items. If you sell a more expensive item, sometimes it doesn't seem too bad, but say you're selling something under $10, it automatically charges $2.95. That makes me want to make sure my prices are higher since you risk making $2 or $3 off of a cheaper item. Hopefully they'll look into that and change their mind about fees. So if you're selling more expensive things, definitely use this app. Otherwise, use Mercari for cheaper items as they don't have a fee.","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"2.34","id":"1331480168"},{"rating":"5","title":"Addicting Fashion App","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"I have been on for 4 years and I can't imagine my life without Poshmark now.

So, the more time you put into it, the faster you sell. Their customer service is great as well, but takes a day or so to respond. I thought their fee was a little high (20%), but for the huge base of buyers, google visibility etc; I don't mind it so much.

Sure they take 20% but it's a nice way to get rid of things, it's built for a mobile phone (putting an item for sale is fast and easy), and it's worth it for their customer support. I received one item not *exactly* as described (I'm picky lol) and received a prompt response from customer support and refund when I returned it. At this point' I've contacted customer service multiple times and have ALWAYS received a helpful response within 24 hours (as buyer and seller). For example, one time my shipping took a day longer than it should have and I was fully refunded. I've gotten some cute stuff on here for discounted prices, including authentic Coach boots that have been AMAZING. There are a few bad people (like any site) but the shady people are honestly quite obvious lol so I wouldn't worry about it. Overall, it's my fave app to buy and sell. I've tried Mercari, Vinted, and eBay and this wins by a long shot. In comparison to Mercari, I prefer Poshmark because it is MUCH safer. Every time I sold or bought or Mercari I felt really sketched out (no wonder there's no fees). Vinted was really similar but I feel like Posh was a lot more user friendly and gave more opportunities to sell. I still use eBay, but I usually use eBay to sell electronics and old video games because things like handbags, phone cases, old clothes, jewelry, etc sells better on Posh because it's a more focused market. And as far as buying goes, you can follow favorite brands (I follow Moschino) and you can see newly listed items for that brand. I love it! Update: To address these few angry reviews saying many of these reviews are \"fake\", I can speak for myself when I say that I have been using Posh since last summer and this is my honest review. I believe that each shopping app has its pros and cons and I would put this as #1 for clothing/women's accessories.","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"2.32.01","id":"1329422818"},{"rating":"5","title":"Love Poshmark!","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"Best \u0026 easy way to sell items from my closet!

I will caution to beware of sellers and buyers who are extremely manipulative. There are all sorts of \"poor single mom\" \"I'm sick and need to sell/ buy cheap, or can't ship for 3 wks\" stories. Post your rules and stick to them. Also the site is slowly becoming a retail site,and the retail is cheap and kind of tacky.  It is a big time commitment with lots of people \" liking\" but not a ton of buying. Be patient, share your items frequently and don't hold items. These people NEVER come back on payday. Mostly the younger girls who shop when they're broke, are the ones to avoid. I would say ignore shares from retail sellers, no holds, and stick to your price, and it might be worth a try. Treat it like a business and you won't be burned. Also, customer service will not email back for 7-10 days. Google the app and you can find a phone number, although I have no idea if they are any more helpful. I was alerted by another posh client of a young girl shopping on a stolen credit card. In the time I waited for posh to respond she set up 3 closets and scammed several people. That, I would say, is the area they definitely fall short, the customer support category.

But the atmosphere is Jr. High school ish. First off let me start off by saying I have been a member since 2012, have several host picks, editor picks and am a top seller. With that being said the people on here seem to have missed out on friendship or popularity growing up they start post outing others for what they are selling in their closets (this has never happened to me I do abide by the listed rules) however I find it quite childish to even concern yourself with what someone else is selling. They act like they have been crowned prom queens when they are selected to host a posh party( when in reality you only have to email a request to host). Then the host pick several items from their own closets for host picks and those items of posters who have kissed their but and shared all their items leading up to the party. The items picked for host picked don't sell any faster it's just a gimmick. What people don't seem to get is u don't have to do all this immature stuff to sell ur items most people know what they are looking for and get on search and buy it. If u can get past the childish atmosphere it's a decent place to sell ur items, besides the huge 20% they charge. They offer no discounts or promotions either it would also be nice to have the option to ship your items yourself. Look in the parties and check out the host picks then look who the host are the host usually have 2/3 items picked as host picks when they host a party. The host picks are the biggest joke women beg for their items to be picked, I have several items that have been chosen but they don't sell any faster it's just a popularity contest. please correct the rating policy some one gave me a rating of 1 said my item was beautiful but it did not fit her! seriously it was listed as the size that was on the label yet I got penalized because she did not ask for measurements or know her size...

People on here have become increasingly arrogant. If you list a item at a price that people don't like they give you hell for it, people make $10 offers on $100 items, they accuse you of selling unauthentic items, they sell unauthentic items, they only send back part of the package when it's returned, and they sell DISGUSTING items. (I saw one girl selling Nike frees for full price and they had turkey feces on the bottom.. One girl sold Nike pros with a menstrual stain in between the legs). If you want to buy an out of season Lululemon or Nike  item, be prepared to pay 3 times the original price for a used item that's being listed as \"practically brand new (stains can be washed out)\". Girls are selling single pairs of \"rare Nike pros\" for a starting rate of $250-$300. One girl is selling a lulu bag that was $150 for $300 - simply because her dingy, scuffed duffle is going for that price brand new on eBay. Come on, ladies! Get real. Also, poshmark does NOTHING to prevent harassment. I had a buyer STALK me from Mercari to Posh for a pair of Shoes. I denied selling to her due to name calling and rude comments she posted on my listings. I sent pictures to customer service.. Nothing was done. I was also called the \"N\" word and nothing was done. But I was told I needed to sell them to her since she bought them. So I sent them. The girl gives me a horrible rating (items cleanliness and not as described) for my brand new item instead of sending them back after the two day send back period. Next thing I know, she has them listed in closet for double what I sold them at AND she got a refund. I lost money and my new pair of shoes. I contacted the police shortly after. BEWARE!

(12/1/15)\n   \nI wrote a honest review below:\n\nI've have been using poshmark for a wile now I have sold 45 listing and make over $400. It is a great way to get rid of clothes I no longer wear or never even worn! But everything has its flaws like the 20% fee they take from every purchase. This does cause me to price my items that are over $20 a lot higher then I want to make I wish they would make the fee a little less just so I can lower my price and sell the item faster (nothing to due with me making more because I would be making the same ether way). There is also a lot of drama, people commenting rude things on listings saying \"I can get this cheaper at (store)\" and other rude things there is no way to delete these comments without deleting you're whole listing poshmark should fix this, there isn't anything really they can do over the rudeness because some people are just not good people I just wish I could delete the negativity off my listing block the user and move on but comments cant be removed. Also I think when you join poshmark you should HAVE to read the rules and guidelines because it seems no one knows  about the fees, shipping, bundles, ext. cussing for a lot of time wasting questions and lowballers not knowing any better. Poshmark is slow at 1st when you are selling but if you read the tips you would be fine. The best thing is to follow other users who like the same brands you are selling the more people you follow the more people will find you're closet. I don't mean following closets with a lot of followers Im talking about real women like you selling there clothes. There is a lot of fakes on poshmark but most of them tell you if they are. The only problem I had is someone sold me a fake triangl bikini and claimed its real I just resold the bikini on my poshmark and stated it wasn't. No big deal really. (I would of returned it but the 3 days expired before I even got the bikini in the mail). I over all love this app and love the feel. Its easier to use then other selling apps I tried. If anyone has any questions about Poshmark and how to make sales you can find my closet @xosam828 and Ill help you make some sales and tell you my tips. :) if you are just downloading the app use code: BWSIW when signing up to get $10 credit to spend free","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"2.32.01","id":"1316473358"},{"rating":"4","title":"Loving it","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"I'm kind of new to poshmark, but so far I have found really good deals and nice people on here!

There is no way to see what would rank highest if not for a given passing fad.\n\nAll the fun of shopping at Sephora, from home; and all the utility of reviews, while in store!","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"3.20.1","id":"1330890377"},{"rating":"5","title":"Love it!","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"This app is great and makes shopping so easy when I can't bear the thought of dealing with mall crowds.

Though Sephora's return policy is awesome, I'm not going to buy a $40 item to try it out. So the free samples they offer in the app along with the mobile offer items is how I discover my new 'loves'.

I think that the mobile app should have a polyvore clipper just like being on a desktop or laptop does, and you can put a title for the picture and etc. Also, i know that in the rules it states that if you don't want your picture to be shared then don't clip them to polyvore. I understand that rule but i think that its annoying when i clip pictures and you see people start liking the picture that you took awhile to clip. I think that polyvore should come up with a picture lock, the picture lock has to be available for mobile and desktop users. The picture lock will allow only the person who clipped the picture to view them and use them and no other users could use the pictures without the person's permission. Also, i think polyvore should have templates for mobile users also, it's harder to make a set and not have a template because i feel like my sets are ugly without templates. And last of all, i think that on the mobile app polyvore should add a button where we could make collections, this will be awesome stuff to add to your app and thank you if you read the whole thing.","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"4.18","id":"1315782011"},{"rating":"5","title":"POLYVORE!!!!!","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"Best app ever!!!

I've gone on it at least once a day and yes you can probably say I'm a little addicted to this app. But it's so difficult to find a fashion app that actually works and makes sense. This app is completely free! I don't have to buy anything from them. If I like a item from their thousands of selections I can always click on the link and it'll bring me to the website that carries it. Sometimes you won't be the only one who has noticed its existence therefor the item may be sold out. You can search for similar items. You'll have your own personal library of items you heart. You can use these items in your sets, to make outfits, or buy later, whatever you wish!

I can't even begin to describe how much it has helped me (and my fashion life - lol) in the long run. Now, when I'm looking to freshen up my wardrobe I create an outfit and buy it 'in bulk' (I buy the entire outfit, except the shoes). This way it's planned and my wardrobe is constantly up to date. Polyvore is also super great because you can find clothes and accessories to suit any budget. The possibilities are limitless and the cropping tools are totally fab. I also like how you can save items from any category of fashion and be notified when they're on sale, it helps you snatch the savings that mean the most to you.

I was amazed at how quickly I learned to love opening my inbox to find their daily deals email. This was the first Christmas season that I felt like a shopping rockstar and it couldn't have been easier. The only problem is that I end up finding too many 'gifts' for myself as well, but I am learning control. \n\nThe only drawback is the shipping time, but now that I understand how it all works I am able to think and plan ahead. Coming from an infamous procrastinator that says a great deal about how much I love this app!\n\nMy only suggestion at this time would be for a more detailed and specific shipping tracking system to help with understanding exactly where in the process and location my products are. Today's on demand and instant gratification world has changed me from a man with little patience to one with almost none, so I find that I can deal with the waiting game much better when I have as much of this information as possible. I'm sure that I would buy even more from ToMo with this type of order information. \n\nThe only problem I have had with the app is that I am not receiving the notification emails for sales that I have missed and selected the option to be notified once the product is available again.

She always likes to listen to music while she gets ready so I thought it would make that process a little easier. I looked at all the major retailers and could not find one that provided all the options at a similar price. The one I found on ToMo had more features and was less expensive.

App Well-Built (w/Minor Issues)","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"I love the products that ToMo sells. They are the unique, best-of-breed, and often hard to find items that just have a way of catching your eye. I found the app well designed. It was intuitive and generally a good experience. I would have given it a 5/5 but I came across a couple of very minor issues. \n\nFirst, I had trouble with the main page maintaining its state during navigation. For example, if I scrolled down to product \"a\", select the item to see the details, then go back to the main page, I often find the focus is not where I left it. Either it takes me back to the top of the product list or to another item that was not selected.\n\nSecond, there seems to be a bug when you are in a detail screen and there are two items that are sold out above each other. For example, given the following layout (where X indicates an item is sold out):\n\nX1    I2    I3\nX4   I5    I6\n\nIf I click on the bottom item, X4, it will take me to the details for the top item, X1. This does not hold true if the item is not directly below it, so if I clicked on I6 (and it was sold out), I would be brought directly to that item and not X1. This is obviously minor, as the item is sold out anyhow, but in some cases I was interested in seeing the details closely and was unable to do so.\n\nAs I mentioned before, these are minor issues. While inconvenient, they do not prevent you from using the app in the manner that it was intended. Perhaps these things will be addressed in the next version...?","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"3.3.6","id":"1319393213"},{"rating":"5","title":"Touch of modern","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"Awsome love it.","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"3.3.6","id":"1318086481"},{"rating":"5","title":"Best app","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"Love the site..

Complaint 2 - watch the return policies! They are different from item to item. Be mindful of those rules and you won't go wrong! Complaint 3 - items have long lead times. I really wish I did not have to wait over a month for some items or they provided a date of delivery, so we can plan around gifts or occasions.\n\nIn general, great products. Great quality. Love you guys! Just need to solve some quirks to make it easier to shop with them!","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"3.3.4","id":"1293106200"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer service is a joke","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"Ordered a gift for my father...something that would have been very nostalgic for him...the perfect gift.  The estimated delivery was 4-6 weeks, and would have arrived just before thanksgiving.  3 days after the expected delivery date, I inquire as to why I haven't received my order. I am told a few days later that there was a processing error with the producer, and my order never shipped. I'm told one is on its way.  However, despite the screw up, there will be no expedition of my order.  So, I'm looking at another 4-6 weeks.  I find out almost a month later, that my order isn't coming at all, \"but here's $5 to use on something else!\"  So, now Christmas is in 9 days, and I have to find some second rate item that won't be as good as the perfect gift I'd found, because TOMO isn't capable of tracking their own orders...

When you swipe down to see the other view of clothes it often thinks you've swiped to the side and takes you to a new item. Back button is useless.

The app continually signs me out of my account every few minutes. A better app would always keep me logged in so I could scroll through the store as long as I want and add something to my wish list without having to log in AGAIN. Seriously, this is so basic. Apps like Facebook, RetailMeNot, Twitter, and others have had this figured out forever. Get it together. \n\n2. The inbox feature is nice but one problem, they sent me a promo code for a 10% discount on the morning of 8/12 that had already expired on 8/8. The live chat feature was very helpful in this situation. They gave me another code for the discount, which I used, but they didn't offer an explanation as to why I received the expired code. Fix. This. Problem. Seriously? 4 days expired?! Come on. \n\n3. When they send you a promo code in the inbox of the app, you cannot copy and paste it into the promo code box at checkout. And they aren't easy codes to remember either (like 10abc). No, they have letters like Q and Y in them with no rhyme or reason.

The app kicks you out constantly and then you have to start over. Asos lets you save stuff for 60 days; I really think you guys should follow that model.

However, after picking out all the items I want the app randomly crashes on me, resetting my shopping cart to nothing. I kept on giving it multiple attempts but never made it to the check out without it crashing. I am both angry and disappointed to say that I wasted so much time for absolutely nothing. Compared to their competing brands like F21, Windsor, Papaya, H\u0026M, Charlotte Russe is really behind on their consumer friendly media front. For instance, their website is really buggy too when using a tablet (I do a lot of my shopping on an iPad). The website won't save my place after scrolling down to my item, looking at it, then going back go that page, I'd have to keep scrolling all over again to get to the item area I was before clicking on the item, only way to bypass is to open a new tab, which is so annoying. Also, the frame of the website barely fits on my iPad when turned horizontal (a preferred view to see more/slightly larger view of items in one row). The website also sometimes doesn't let me scroll down further after scrolling for a while, the page would flicker. Images take forever to load. This is very frustrating for me because I love their clothes/pricing but this makes it almost impossible for me to actually get any shopping done with Charlotte Russe, since I have a very busy school/work schedule being a medical school student. I squeeze in my shopping in the comfort of my home ahen I have time, in my pjs, on my ipad. I hope someone in your software department is reading this and planning on making a change!!

I don't have many issues with the app as far as bugs, but I wish I was able to view my wishlist on the app. Currently, I can only do that on the website. I'd purchase through the app more often if I was able to see my favorite items that I've saved to my wishlist. \n\nSecond, I think the current one-time Urban On Exclusives such as \"UO Shoes\" or \"UO Music\" should reset every four months, or even every six months from the time of purchase. The badge doesn't have to reset, but the discount is nice especially for a store that hardly has store-wide sale events. \n\nSo far the app is an average three stars to me.

Let us know!\" icon every time I open the homepage, I can't help but notice how smoothly the app functions. It does not resemble the laggy connection that the Forever 21 and Luulla app does, (no offense to Forever 21 and Luulla) and provides you with an efficient way to scroll through their products without pesky coupons or sales offers. \n\nYou might have noticed that I only rated this app four stars, and there is a valid reason behind that. (Or at least I think it's a valid reason.)  On the Etsy and Lulla app, they have the option for you to heart or \"love\" certain items or products to go back to and view on your profile. Even We Heart It has this option (granted, you're not shopping for anything, but it still supports my case). So basically you can select \"favorite\" items that you don't necessarily want to buy, but would consider it. Or maybe you want to look back at them later.\n\nMy point: I would really like this app to have this feature, or something similar to it. It would be a nice addition to the already amazing options it currently offers. I don't mean to sound picky or bitchy, but like I said: I rarely EVER have anything significant to voice my opinion about having to do with any app. So this would be a nice add on to the Urban Outfitters website and applications. \n\nOverall: good app, nice products, very convenient.","vote_count":"0","upvotes":0,"app_version":"6.5.1","id":"1283390964"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mess","downvotes":0.0,"vote_sum":"0","content":"This app is a complete mess right now.
